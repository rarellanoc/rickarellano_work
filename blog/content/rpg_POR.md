Summary: Knowing about Resonance in social media allows you to create cultural assets. 


So welcome. This is the RPG model, a relational model, a model for communication, but also, if you apply this to social media or marketing, it’s all right. It will work. And that’s one of the pain points these days. So, I want to solve it or attack it. To take it not a burden.

Do not take social media as a burden or any mode of advertising you have, not as a burden but as an enjoyable thing. Let’s start; I say multiple times, but I’m Rick. I’m an author, and I write about communities, mainly taken from the internet or specially developed on the internet as certain subcultures or specific courses that I discovered on the internet and ripple out in my real-life relationships. And I wrote about those in my recent books. 

What it’s essential right now is that the R P G method, which is highly based on that input, on some practices, so this is not coming from thin air. Still, it’s a long tradition of refining a specific outlook on communication and experience as our way to express ourselves.

So, let’s start. If you are here, I’m glad you are stuck with your message. So you may want to get better at communicating your own business, ideas, and outputs into the world.

And that’s why I’m here. That’s why we are here. And the thing. It all starts with resonance. Resonance is a fundamental concept, a big concept that I want to incorporate a little bit more in your own set of rules on your own set of language because it has to do with language, it has to do with how a profound, tiny message is deeper and stays more time than a megaphone, than a highly heard sound like a cannon that we all hear but, it’s not impactful, right? It is even annoying. For example, the current state of advertising is annoying, and we want to cut that.

We want to start resonating with those tiny messages that are important and impactful at the end of the day but also in the sense of culture and cultural resonance. Say you are part of a tribe or community, and you start speaking the language of your community. That’s why I’m referring to resonance and resonance within yourself, how this applies to me, and how this doesn’t.

And that’s the resonance. Resonance comes from the comparison to a bell-like thing. A bell is resonant. And a cannon is amplification, and most advertising today is amplification. So stop doing that for now. And that’s the power of resonance. I think this started with a friend of mine that invented some words here and then, and we began to understand them, and everyone who understood those words was part of a tribe.

And the same as with dialects, it happens that you start speaking the dialect and you start. It was making a tribe unconsciously. And anyone not part of that tribe is out of the boundaries. But it’s not about boundaries. As I said, it’s not about physical boundaries but more language resonance. So, if that word started to resonate with you and it started to form a location, even not a geographical location, it began to define a group.

And that’s what language did for us. 

And this applies to social media when you start occupying some platform, liking content, and resonating with a certain style. And to apply the resonance part, I state that you should save those posts like pins and bookmarks.

Those posts are to create a collection and not let it go to waste. So then you can. Review it, and you can curate those posts as if they were from you and incorporate them slowly into a catalog in an orderly manner to

 Create something at the first stage from this resonance, and you will find that some catalogs will be more resonant with you, and that’s all fine. And it will signal a mode of communicating that. You are most resonant with it, which will be your current output.

And then you will start finding that you. You don’t need to generate content, but you want to develop content or create a work of art, a message, a product, or an offer. So you don’t need to, but you’ll want to after you collect most people’s work because you’ll want not to be silent all the time.

You will want naturally to generate something for yourself. And this doesn’t happen from the point of reaction. So that’s why the power of the pause is essential. And that’s what I will cover right now, the power of the pause.
