Summary: Knowing about Resonance in social media allows you to create cultural assets. 


Resonance is a fundamental concept, a big concept that I want to incorporate a little bit more in your own set of rules on your own set of language. It has to do with how a profound tiny message is deeper and stays more time than a megaphone, than a highly heard sound like a cannon that we all hear but, it’s not impactful. 

We want to start resonating with those tiny messages that are important at the end of the day, but also in the sense of cultural resonance. 

Say you are part of a tribe or a community, and you start speaking the language of your community. That’s why I’m referring to resonance. But also resonance within yourself, how this applies to me, and how this doesn’t.

Resonance comes from the comparison to a bell-like thing. A bell is resonant. A cannon is amplification, and most advertising today is amplification. So stop doing that for now.

I think this started with a friend of mine that invented some words here and then, and we began to understand them, and everyone who understood those words was part of a tribe. Same as with dialects, it happens that you start speaking the dialect. We were making a tribe unconsciously, and we started to form a location, even not a geographical location, but it began to define a group.

And that’s what language did for us. 

And this applies to social media too, when you start occupying some platform, liking content, and resonating with a certain style. And to apply the resonance part. If you want to apply this right away, I state that you should save those posts like pins and **bookmarks**.

Those saved posts are to create a collection and not let it go to waste. So then you can review it, and you can **curate** those posts as if they were from you, and incorporate them slowly into a catalog in an orderly manner to create something at this first stage from this resonance, 

You will find that some catalogs will be more resonant with you. And it will signal a mode of communicating that you are most resonant with. 

And then you will start finding that you don’t need to generate content, but you *want* to develop content or create a work of art, a message, a product, or an offer. You don’t need to, really. But you’ll want to, after you collect most people’s work because you’ll want not to be silent all the time.

You will want naturally to generate something for yourself and for your group. And this doesn’t happen from a point of reaction. So that’s why the power of the pause is essential too (in the next chapter).
