Summary: Our interactions can generate a ripple effect, like a snowball effect towards others. 


One of the most powerful ideas, one of my favorites, is the idea that our interactions can generate a ripple effect, like a snowball effect towards the rest. That is. Suppose you connected with a person in a natural, deep, and joyful way. In his subsequent interactions, that person will transmit the same vibe to others.

So, the important thing is to know that your next interaction, or whatever you are doing in the world, can be a gift not only for the person in front of you but for the rest of the people and so on. 

Thatâ€™s the beauty of this.
