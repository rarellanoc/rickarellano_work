Summary: The first part, understanding what is presence.

Well, let’s start this is a little extended version of the video that I made a few days ago, which is called Train the Trainer and was directed for you who are in limbo and probably if you are here because you were interested, or at least you want to know a little more about what’s going on and this video is to solve and patch some things, that is, explain some things that I hadn’t said.

So, first things. It is this order that I tell you is presence-curiosity, appreciation-craft, and integrity-collaboration. 

This comes a bit from various sources, but it is hierarchical in the sense that one cannot be done without going through it, that is, without having gone through the previous stages. Bottom-up.

It starts with presence and curiosity because I think they are two of the most fundamental aspects of any interaction. 

The concept of presence is basically when someone says *it wasn’t even necessary for him to talk* like a rockstar who stands on stage to grab all the attention.

And it has been said that this is a high level of *presence*. because the guy is used to obviously, but the guy gradually went from a small stage to a much bigger stage. little by little. So he got used to it, internally

One aspect of presence is that it is not necessary to *add* presence.

If we try to *make presence*, for example, it’s going to go not end up well. 

It’s basically a practice, like where we put our attention and where our attention goes when it goes out in, towards this relationship that we establish with others.

Why do we want to start with presence? Let’s check. 

There is a game called ‘the game of noticing’ that I am going to give you how to do it next. But the important thing is that all these kinds of things are to improve in the relational sphere because we would like to improve. 

The first step in The game of noticing is that basically, one says using the phrase: *I notice that*, and *when I heard you say _ I notice _*

That didn’t seem so difficult at first glance, but in situ, at a time when you’re with another person, you’ll realize that it’s a little more challenging than it seems.

 The game starts like this: one says I notice that and the other says when I hear that I notice what Then it becomes like a cycle when I hear that I notice that given gives when I hear that I notice what is understood. 

Then a loop is formed if we take turns.

So these could be done perfectly as a more intimate practice, but they can also be done, as a demo. 

You can place a line of people in pairs. 

There are always two energies, one is to put more energy, more Yang. More strength, more direction. and another Yin is like saying good. whatever comes, open to even possibilities. Then the game between these two dynamics is called polarity.

But here the idea is to emphasize curiosity. To seek actively to find what is going on in the person in front of us it’s going to give us is a gateway to the next step, which is appreciation and craft. 

Appreciation is the way in which we can be open to the present moment and especially when the moment is not ideal, and it is not as we would like.

That’s it.

See you in part 2.
