Summary: I'm passionate about being able to slow time, notice and reveal our blindspots.

Today I am going to review once again a general sweep of topics that are interesting to me, that you could even say that I am passionate about, that is powerful, or that have had an impact on how I develop.

This time. Yes, I am not going to remove a few external sources. And I’m going to talk about a slightly broader topic that I call: *the difference that makes a difference.*

I’m going to explain what it’s about. And so that it is understood that it is precisely what I am passionate about that concept or that way of understanding relationships. This is how you want the difference that makes a difference basically understood by isolating the components that make a product, or a conversation, have an impact beyond the ordinary.

That is if we are super slow to detect exactly what happened in an interaction. Internally and externally, it is possible to reproduce and learn a little about how the internal experience was and then, not duplicate it, but rather learn from the motivations of that person to try to emulate or try to follow someone who has those skills a little. beyond the ordinary.

For example: in rational practice, it is established that assuming one’s own experience helps other people to understand what the person is experiencing, but relationships, of course, are complicated, they are messy sometimes.

We need verbal tools so that the other person can understand exactly what we were feeling and can receive the impact of that as well.

So in trying to isolate the difference that makes the difference, it’s basically not reporting what we did not report an emotion. A deep emotion can be one.

Something intense happened to us. But if we report it, it probably won’t turn out as well as experiencing it at the same time.

So a degree of vulnerability is required to make this happen because if we are not open to risk or surprise here, there will not be this difference that makes a difference.

So. Trying to isolate that requires, putting in a superb degree of deep attention and slowing down a bit to say hey *stop*.
 
And detect exactly what it is, what, or what our unconscious mechanisms sometimes produce the opposite effect to what we are looking for,

For example, in attraction, in male-female relationships.

Men want to find the difference that makes the difference to make them more attractive. It is an application of this.

So, to do that, you can apply these techniques that stretch the time a bit, taking a couple of seconds and we can analyze them in 10, 20.

The idea was to expand it a bit to see what was really happening, what intention the person had, what tics they had, what expressions they have that are totally added, what they didn’t want to do but do them anyway and what was the result in the experience of the other person.

Aligning these three things or these elements that I mentioned can isolate what makes the difference.

This requires a certain order, of course, a method to, be able, as a methodology, to be able to pay attention and facilitate exchanges that have to do with this difference.

That more or less, is what I can synthesize from this in this way of capturing a moment for our benefit and for the community’s understanding of the rest they may have about us and our experience.

If you want to check out more about this, there are *the authentic building blocks*. That is in the draft. He says: What was the difference that made the difference?

*A conversational movement is changing the way we experience the present moment, half feedback (I told you this process of seeing what the other is experiencing) half vulnerability, authentic practices are transformed into a way of looking at our interactions with new eyes. *

See you in the next one.
