    <p>Today I am going to review once again a general sweep of topics that are interesting to me, that you could even say that I am passionate about, that is powerful, or that have had an impact on how I develop.</p>
<p>This time. Yes, I am not going to talk about external sources. I’m going to talk about a slightly broader topic that I call: <em>the difference that makes a difference.</em></p>
<p>To explain what it’s about, it's necessary to say that this is precisely what I am passionate about that concept, which is a way of understanding relationships. </p>
<p>The difference that makes a difference is basically understood by isolating the components that make a product, a conversation, or any interaction that have an impact beyond the ordinary.</p>
<p>That is, if we go super slow, with the aim of detecting exactly what happened in social interaction, internally and externally, it is possible to reproduce and learn a little about how the internal experience was exactly, and then, we don't want to try to duplicate it but rather learn from the motivations of that person to try to emulate deeply or try to follow someone who inspires us, who has those skills beyond the ordinary.</p>
<p>For example in relational practice. It is established that admitting our own experience helps other people to understand what the person is experiencing. Relationships, of course, are more complicated than that. They are messy sometimes.</p>
<p>So we need verbal tools the other person would understand. To get exactly what is what we were feeling, and let the person receive the impact of that experience as well.</p>
<p>In the aim to isolate <em>the difference that makes the difference</em>, we should know that we basically avoid reporting what we did. We do not report an emotion. A deep emotion needs something else. </p>
<p>Say something intense happened to us. If we report it, it wouldn't turn out as well as experiencing first hand, or at the same time.</p>
<p>So a degree of vulnerability is required to make this happen because if we are not open to risk or a level of surprise here, the great moments will not be available. </p>
<p>So. Trying to isolate that, requires putting in a superb degree of attention, and slowing things down a bit to say: hey <em>stop</em> right there. </p>
<p>This is done as a practice, to detect exactly what is it, what are, or what were our unconscious mechanisms. The things we do produce the opposite effect of what we are looking for. </p>
<p>For example, let’s take the case of <em>attraction</em>, in male-female relationships.</p>
<p>Men want to find the difference that makes the difference, to make them more attractive. </p>
<p>But in order to do that, we need to apply these techniques that <em>stretch time</em> a bit, taking a couple of seconds to analyze the behavior. </p>
<p>The idea was to expand time a bit to see what was really happening, what was the intention, what unconscious twitches they had, and what expressions they have that are totally unnecessary. Expressions they didn’t want to do, but they do them anyway. What was causing a stir or a different experience in the other person?</p>
<p>Aligning these three things or these elements that I mentioned can start to isolate what makes <em>the difference</em>.</p>
<p>This requires a certain order, of course, a method to be able, as a methodology, to be able to pay attention and facilitate exchanges that have to do with this stretching of time. </p>
<p>This is what I can synthesize in this way of capturing a moment, for our benefit and for our communities understanding of the persons involved. The understanding they might have about us, and our internal experience.</p>
<p>If you want to check out more about this, there is <em>The authentic building blocks</em>, the book. If we review the back matter, we will read: <em>What was the difference that made the difference?</em></p>
<p><em>A conversational movement is changing the way we experience the present moment. Half feedback</em> (I told you this process of seeing what the other is experiencing) <em>half vulnerability, Authentic practices become a way of looking at our interactions with fresh eyes.</em></p>
<p>See you at the next one. </p>
