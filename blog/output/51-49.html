    <p>Hey guys. Today I want to talk about the 51:49 concept, which is a mind-blowing concept for me. I took it from an input source from the â€˜so suaveâ€™ forum, The Book of Pook.  Pook is a character, a highly anonymous guy from the internet that reveals a series of tactics, heuristics, or techniques to seduce women.</p>
<p>But more importantly, I remember that Pook stated that it was to find peace in himself, which is very similar to what I like to do. And, women were an afterthought after he found himself, in a way. So Pook revealed the 51:49 concept, which I applied highly in my relationships.</p>
<p>I remember once when I was in a nearby city, and I was with a friend, and I was going to take off and head home. Still, my friend invited me to a party with some female companions. Then the 51:49 helped me at that moment to decide <em>not</em> to go to the party, to stay on integrity, and to have fun even in the terminal waiting, clearly on the good side of the decision. Otherwise, I was I would be swayed in the sense of not being in alignment with my values, and integrity is a critical component of this series, of this program, if you like, of the other products that I have.</p>
<p>And integrity is maintaining what we want even if tempted to go in different directions, maintaining our stance and what we like to do in the place. </p>
<p>So 51 49  comes from the gambling realm, in the sense of this coming from the casino because the casino doesnâ€™t want to â€“if you go to the casinoâ€“, the casino doesnâ€™t want to win by a high margin because even if gamblers, for example, want to win big, they, they end up losing almost everything, right?</p>
<p>The casino wins by a small margin each time, and thatâ€™s the key to win winning, in my opinion. So, following this rule till the end will work wonders for you in every decision you take. And decisions are, are gut impulses, right? Sometimes decisions come from the gut and donâ€™t need a refined story to be effective.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we feel that we need to explain ours to others, which is normal and acceptable, but sometimes gut impulses tell us a better story and direct us in better ways to navigate this world. </p>
<p>So 51:49 is the key to those moments when you have to decide for one side or the other, and you donâ€™t want to be in the 49. right? You want to be in the 51. </p>
<p>So thatâ€™s it. The heuristic thatâ€™s the shortcut. If you want, try to apply it, in your decisions, in essential decisions or decisions that feel important for you, and I think it will work wonders for you, and it would be an entry point to this, my world, and my upcoming products.</p>
