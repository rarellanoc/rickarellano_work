    <p>Resonance is a fundamental concept, a big concept that I want to incorporate a little bit more in your own set of rules on your own set of language. It has to do with how a profound tiny message is deeper and stays more time than a megaphone, than a highly heard sound like a cannon that we all hear but, it’s not impactful. </p>
<p>We want to start resonating with those tiny messages that are important at the end of the day, but also in the sense of cultural resonance. </p>
<p>Say you are part of a tribe or a community, and you start speaking the language of your community. That’s why I’m referring to resonance. But also resonance within yourself, how this applies to me, and how this doesn’t.</p>
<p>Resonance comes from the comparison to a bell-like thing. A bell is resonant. A cannon is amplification, and most advertising today is amplification. So stop doing that for now.</p>
<p>I think this started with a friend of mine that invented some words here and then, and we began to understand them, and everyone who understood those words was part of a tribe. Same as with dialects, it happens that you start speaking the dialect. We were making a tribe unconsciously, and we started to form a location, even not a geographical location, but it began to define a group.</p>
<p>And that’s what language did for us. </p>
<p>And this applies to social media too, when you start occupying some platform, liking content, and resonating with a certain style. And to apply the resonance part. If you want to apply this right away, I state that you should save those posts like pins and <strong>bookmarks</strong>.</p>
<p>Those saved posts are to create a collection and not let it go to waste. So then you can review it, and you can <strong>curate</strong> those posts as if they were from you, and incorporate them slowly into a catalog in an orderly manner to create something at this first stage from this resonance, </p>
<p>You will find that some catalogs will be more resonant with you. And it will signal a mode of communicating that you are most resonant with. </p>
<p>And then you will start finding that you don’t need to generate content, but you <em>want</em> to develop content or create a work of art, a message, a product, or an offer. You don’t need to, really. But you’ll want to, after you collect most people’s work because you’ll want not to be silent all the time.</p>
<p>You will want naturally to generate something for yourself and for your group. And this doesn’t happen from a point of reaction. So that’s why the power of the pause is essential too (in the next chapter). </p>
