    <p>So welcome. This is the RPG model, it's a relational model, a model for communication, but also if you apply this to social media or marketing, it's all right. It will work. and that's one of the pain-points these days. So, I want to solve it or attack it. In order to take it not a burden.</p>
<p>Do not take social media as a burden or any mode of advertising that you have, not as a burden, but as an enjoyable thing. Uh, so let's start, I say multiple times, but I'm Rick I'm an author and I write about communities, especially taken from the internet or specially developed on the internet as certain subcultures or certain courses that I discovered on the internet and ripple out in my own real-life relationships. And I wrote about those in my recent books. </p>
<p>What it's important right now, it's that the R P G method, it's, that is highly based on that input, on some practices, so this is not coming from thin air but it's a long tradition of refining a specific outlook to communication, to experience, too, as our own way to expressing ourselves.</p>
<p>So, let's start, uh, if you are here, I'm glad if you are here, you maybe are stuck with your, message right now. So you maybe want to, get better at communicating your own business, your own ideas, and your own outputs into the world.</p>
<p>And that's why I'm here. That's why we are here. And the thing. is it all starts with resonance. Resonance is a fundamental concept, a big concept that I want to incorporate a little bit more in your own set of rules on your own set of language because it has to do with language, it has to do with how a profound, tiny message is deeper and stays more time than a megaphone, than a highly heard sound like a cannon that we all hear but, it's not impactful, right? It is even annoying. Um, for example, the current state of advertising these days is annoying and we wanna cut that.</p>
<p>We wanna start resonating with those tiny messages that are important and that are impactful at the end of the day, but also resonant in a sense of culture, and cultural resonance. Say you are part of a tribe or, or a community and you start speaking the language of your community. That's why I'm referring to resonance and also resonance within yourself, how this applies to me, how this doesn't apply to me.</p>
<p>And that's the resonance. Resonance comes from the comparison to a bell-like thing a bell is resonant. And a cannon is an amplification, as I said, and most advertising today is amplification. So stop doing that for now. And that's the power of resonance. I think this started with, a friend of mine that invented some words here and then, and we started to understand them and everyone who understand those words was part of a tribe.</p>
<p>And the same as with dialects, it happens that you start speaking the dialect and you start. making a tribe unconsciously. And anyone who is not part of that tribe is out of the boundaries. But it's not about boundaries. It's not about physical boundaries, but, uh, more language resonance, as I said. So, if that word started to resonate with you and it started to form a location even not a geographical location but it started to define a group.</p>
<p>And that's what language did for us. </p>
<p>And this applied to social media is when you start, occupying some platform you start liking some content and you start resonating with a certain style. And in order to apply the resonance part, I state that you should save those posts like pins, and bookmarks.</p>
<p>Those posts are in order to create a collection and not let it go to waste. So then you can. Review it and you can curate those posts as if they were from you, and incorporate them slowly into a catalog, in an orderly manner in order to</p>
<p>Create something at the first stage from this resonance, and you will find that some catalogs will be more resonant with you, and that's all fine. And it will signal, a mode of communicating that. you are most resonant with, and that will be your output for now.</p>
<p>And then you will start finding that you. You don't need to generate content, but you want to generate content or create a piece of work of art, a message, a product, or an offer. So you don't need to, but you'll want to after you collect most people's work because you'll want to not be silent all the time.</p>
<p>you will want naturally to generate something for yourself. And, this doesn't happen from a point of reaction. So that's why the power of the pause is important. And that's what I will cover right now, the power of the pause. </p>
