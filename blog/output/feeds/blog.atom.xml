Today I wanna talk about the 51 49 concept, which is a mind-blowing concept for me. I took it from an input source from the South Valley Forum, which is the book of Pook.  Pook is a character, a highly anonymous guy from the internet that reveals a series of tactics of heuristics or techniques in order to seduce women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, in order to, I remember that book stated that it was in order to. To find peace in himself, which is very alike to what I like to do. And, the women were an afterthought after he found himself in, in a way. So Pook revealed the 51:49 concept, which I applied highly in my relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember once when I was in a nearby city and, I was with a friend and I was. I'm going to take off and at home and, but my friend invited me to some party with some female companionships and the, the 51 49 helped me in, at that moment in order to decide to not go to the party to stay on integrity and, and to have fun even in the terminal waiting. Clearly on the good side of the decision. Otherwise, I was I would be like a cannot sway, sway in the site in the sense of not aligned with my values and integrity is, is a key component of this. Series of this program, if you like, of other products that I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And integrity in the sense of maintaining what we want even if tempted to go in different directions, maintaining our, our stance and, and really what we, what, what we like to do in the, in the. So 51 49 came from, comes from the, the gambling ream, in the sense of this comes from the casino because the casino doesn't want to if you go to the casino, the casino doesn't want to win by a high margin because even if gamblers, for example, wants to win big, they, they end up losing almost everything, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The casino wins by a small margin each time, and that's the key to win winning, in my opinion. So, if you follow this rule till the end it will work wonders for you in every decision you take. And decisions are, are gut impulses, right? Sometimes and decisions from the gut don't need to have a refined story in order to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Sometimes, we feel that we need to explain ours to other people, which is totally normal and fine, but sometimes Gut impulses tell us a better story and direct us in better ways to navigate, this world. So 51 49 is the key to those moments when you have to decide for one side or the other, and you don't want to be in the 49. right? You want to be in the 51. So that's it. The heuristic, that's the shortcut. If you want, and try to apply it, in your decisions, in important decisions or important decisions that'll feel important for you, and I think it will work wonders for you, and it would be an entry point to this, my world, and to my upcoming products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Check, the link below and I will lead you to more of this decision-making and stick to foster your development. So that's it. See you around and see you the next time. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="inner-game"></category><category term="relationships"></category></entry><entry><title>Train the trainer (preview)</title><link href="/t3-presence.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-30T10:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-30T15:06:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Rick Arellano</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-03-30:/t3-presence.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first part, understanding what is presence.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, let’s start this is a little extended version of the video that I made a few days ago, which is called Train the Trainer and was directed for you who are in limbo and probably if you are here because you were interested, or at least you want to know a little more about what’s going on and this video is to solve and patch some things, that is, explain some things that I hadn’t said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first things. It is this order that I tell you is presence-curiosity, appreciation-craft, and integrity-collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes a bit from various sources, but it is hierarchical in the sense that one cannot be done without going through it, that is, without having gone through the previous stages. Bottom-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with presence and curiosity because I think they are two of the most fundamental aspects of any interaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of presence is basically when someone says &lt;em&gt;it wasn’t even necessary for him to talk&lt;/em&gt; like a rockstar who stands on stage to grab all the attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it has been said that this is a high level of &lt;em&gt;presence&lt;/em&gt;. because the guy is used to obviously, but the guy gradually went from a small stage to a much bigger stage. little by little. So he got used to it, internally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of presence is that it is not necessary to &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we try to &lt;em&gt;make presence&lt;/em&gt;, for example, it’s going to go not end up well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s basically a practice, like where we put our attention and where our attention goes when it goes out in, towards this relationship that we establish with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we want to start with presence? Let’s check. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a game called ‘the game of noticing’ that I am going to give you how to do it next. But the important thing is that all these kinds of things are to improve in the relational sphere because we would like to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in The game of noticing is that basically, one says using the phrase: &lt;em&gt;I notice that&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;when I heard you say _ I notice _&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That didn’t seem so difficult at first glance, but in situ, at a time when you’re with another person, you’ll realize that it’s a little more challenging than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game starts like this: one says I notice that and the other says when I hear that I notice what Then it becomes like a cycle when I hear that I notice that given gives when I hear that I notice what is understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a loop is formed if we take turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So these could be done perfectly as a more intimate practice, but they can also be done, as a demo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can place a line of people in pairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always two energies, one is to put more energy, more Yang. More strength, more direction. and another Yin is like saying good. whatever comes, open to even possibilities. Then the game between these two dynamics is called polarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here the idea is to emphasize curiosity. To seek actively to find what is going on in the person in front of us it’s going to give us is a gateway to the next step, which is appreciation and craft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appreciation is the way in which we can be open to the present moment and especially when the moment is not ideal, and it is not as we would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in part 2. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="inner-game"></category><category term="relationships"></category></entry><entry><title>The difference that makes the difference</title><link href="/the-difference.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-30T10:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-30T15:11:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Rick Arellano</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-03-30:/the-difference.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm passionate about being able to slow time, notice and reveal our blindspots.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to review once again a general sweep of topics that are interesting to me, that you could even say that I am passionate about, that is powerful, or that have had an impact on how I develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time. Yes, I am not going to remove a few external sources. And I’m going to talk about a slightly broader topic that I call: &lt;em&gt;the difference that makes a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to explain what it’s about. And so that it is understood that it is precisely what I am passionate about that concept or that way of understanding relationships. This is how you want the difference that makes a difference basically understood by isolating the components that make a product, or a conversation, have an impact beyond the ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is if we are super slow to detect exactly what happened in an interaction. Internally and externally, it is possible to reproduce and learn a little about how the internal experience was and then, not duplicate it, but rather learn from the motivations of that person to try to emulate or try to follow someone who has those skills a little. beyond the ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: in rational practice, it is established that assuming one’s own experience helps other people to understand what the person is experiencing, but relationships, of course, are complicated, they are messy sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need verbal tools so that the other person can understand exactly what we were feeling and can receive the impact of that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in trying to isolate the difference that makes the difference, it’s basically not reporting what we did not report an emotion. A deep emotion can be one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something intense happened to us. But if we report it, it probably won’t turn out as well as experiencing it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a degree of vulnerability is required to make this happen because if we are not open to risk or surprise here, there will not be this difference that makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Trying to isolate that requires, putting in a superb degree of deep attention and slowing down a bit to say hey &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And detect exactly what it is, what, or what our unconscious mechanisms sometimes produce the opposite effect to what we are looking for,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in attraction, in male-female relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men want to find the difference that makes the difference to make them more attractive. It is an application of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to do that, you can apply these techniques that stretch the time a bit, taking a couple of seconds and we can analyze them in 10, 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was to expand it a bit to see what was really happening, what intention the person had, what tics they had, what expressions they have that are totally added, what they didn’t want to do but do them anyway and what was the result in the experience of the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aligning these three things or these elements that I mentioned can isolate what makes the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires a certain order, of course, a method to, be able, as a methodology, to be able to pay attention and facilitate exchanges that have to do with this difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That more or less, is what I can synthesize from this in this way of capturing a moment for our benefit and for the community’s understanding of the rest they may have about us and our experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to check out more about this, there are &lt;em&gt;the authentic building blocks&lt;/em&gt;. That is in the draft. He says: What was the difference that made the difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*A conversational movement is changing the way we experience the present moment, half feedback (I told you this process of seeing what the other is experiencing) half vulnerability, authentic practices are transformed into a way of looking at our interactions with new eyes. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in the next one. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="inner-game"></category><category term="relationships"></category></entry><entry><title>The power of resonance</title><link href="/the-power-of-resonance.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-30T10:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-30T15:06:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Rick Arellano</name></author><id>tag:None,2023-03-30:/the-power-of-resonance.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Knowing about Resonance in social media allows you to create cultural assets.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So welcome. This is the RPG model, it's a relational model, a model for communication, but also if you apply this to social media or marketing, it's all right. It will work. and that's one of the pain-points these days. So, I want to solve it or attack it. In order to take it not a burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not take social media as a burden or any mode of advertising that you have, not as a burden, but as an enjoyable thing. Uh, so let's start, I say multiple times, but I'm Rick I'm an author and I write about communities, especially taken from the internet or specially developed on the internet as certain subcultures or certain courses that I discovered on the internet and ripple out in my own real-life relationships. And I wrote about those in my recent books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it's important right now, it's that the R P G method, it's, that is highly based on that input, on some practices, so this is not coming from thin air but it's a long tradition of refining a specific outlook to communication, to experience, too, as our own way to expressing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's start, uh, if you are here, I'm glad if you are here, you maybe are stuck with your, message right now. So you maybe want to, get better at communicating your own business, your own ideas, and your own outputs into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's why I'm here. That's why we are here. And the thing. is it all starts with resonance. Resonance is a fundamental concept, a big concept that I want to incorporate a little bit more in your own set of rules on your own set of language because it has to do with language, it has to do with how a profound, tiny message is deeper and stays more time than a megaphone, than a highly heard sound like a cannon that we all hear but, it's not impactful, right? It is even annoying. Um, for example, the current state of advertising these days is annoying and we wanna cut that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanna start resonating with those tiny messages that are important and that are impactful at the end of the day, but also resonant in a sense of culture, and cultural resonance. Say you are part of a tribe or, or a community and you start speaking the language of your community. That's why I'm referring to resonance and also resonance within yourself, how this applies to me, how this doesn't apply to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's the resonance. Resonance comes from the comparison to a bell-like thing a bell is resonant. And a cannon is an amplification, as I said, and most advertising today is amplification. So stop doing that for now. And that's the power of resonance. I think this started with, a friend of mine that invented some words here and then, and we started to understand them and everyone who understand those words was part of a tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the same as with dialects, it happens that you start speaking the dialect and you start. making a tribe unconsciously. And anyone who is not part of that tribe is out of the boundaries. But it's not about boundaries. It's not about physical boundaries, but, uh, more language resonance, as I said. So, if that word started to resonate with you and it started to form a location even not a geographical location but it started to define a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's what language did for us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this applied to social media is when you start, occupying some platform you start liking some content and you start resonating with a certain style. And in order to apply the resonance part, I state that you should save those posts like pins, and bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those posts are in order to create a collection and not let it go to waste. So then you can. Review it and you can curate those posts as if they were from you, and incorporate them slowly into a catalog, in an orderly manner in order to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create something at the first stage from this resonance, and you will find that some catalogs will be more resonant with you, and that's all fine. And it will signal, a mode of communicating that. you are most resonant with, and that will be your output for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you will start finding that you. You don't need to generate content, but you want to generate content or create a piece of work of art, a message, a product, or an offer. So you don't need to, but you'll want to after you collect most people's work because you'll want to not be silent all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you will want naturally to generate something for yourself. And, this doesn't happen from a point of reaction. So that's why the power of the pause is important. And that's what I will cover right now, the power of the pause. &lt;/p&gt;

That is. If you connected with a person in a natural, deep, and joyful way. That person in his next interactions will transmit the same vibe to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the important thing is to know that your next interaction, or whatever you are doing in the world, can be a gift not only for the person in front of you but for the rest of the people and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the beauty of this. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="inner-game"></category><category term="relationships"></category></entry></feed>
