    <p>Well, let’s start. This is an extended version of the video I made a few days ago, called Train the Trainer, directed for you in limbo. Probably you are here because you are interested, or at least you want to know a little more about what’s going on, and this article is to solve and patch some things, that is, explain some things that I haven’t said.</p>
<p>So, first things first. I tell you an order: presence-curiosity, appreciation-craft, and integrity-collaboration. </p>
<p>This comes from various sources, but it is hierarchical in that we cannot do the latter without going through it, that is, without going through the previous stages. Bottom-up.</p>
<p>It starts with presence and curiosity because they are two of the most fundamental aspects of any interaction. </p>
<p>The concept of presence is basically when someone says <em>it wasn’t necessary for him even to talk</em>, like a rockstar who stands on stage and grabs all the attention.</p>
<p>And it has been said that this is a high level of <em>presence</em>. Because the guy is used to obviously, the rockstar gradually went from a small stage to a much larger one. Little by little. So he got used to it internally as well. </p>
<p>One aspect of presence is that it is unnecessary to <em>add</em> presence.</p>
<p>If we try to <em>make presence</em>, for example, it will not end up well. </p>
<p>It’s a practice, focusing on where we put our attention and where our attention goes, when it goes out, towards the relationship we establish with others.</p>
<p>Why do we start with presence? Let’s check. </p>
<p>There is a game called ‘the game of noticing’ that I am going to give. But the important thing is that all these things are made to improve in the relational sphere because we would like to improve, right?</p>
<p>The first step in The Game of Noticing is one starts using the phrase: <em>I notice _</em>, and then the other person says: <em>when I hear you say _ I notice _</em></p>
<p>That didn’t seem difficult at first glance, but when you’re with another person, you’ll realize it’s a little more challenging.</p>
<p>Again, the game starts like this: one says: I notice.</p>
<p>Then the other says when: I hear that I notice _. Then it becomes a cycle. A loop is formed if we take turns and stick to the template. </p>
<p>So these stems could be practiced ideally as an intimate practice but can also be presented as a demo. </p>
<p>You can place a line of people in pairs. </p>
<p>Between two people, there will always be two kinds of energy. One is to put a high level of energy, a classical Yang approach: strength, direction. And the other way is the Yin side, which is like saying, ok, good, whatever comes, I’m open to new possibilities. </p>
<p>Then the game between these two dynamics is called polarity.</p>
<p>Here the idea is not to foster polarity but to emphasize curiosity. To seek actively, to want to find out what is going on in the person in front of us. This will give us a gateway to the next step: appreciation and craft. </p>
<p>Appreciation is how we can be open to the present moment, especially when the moment is not ideal and is not as we would like.</p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>See you in part 2. </p>
