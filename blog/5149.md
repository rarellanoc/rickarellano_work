Summary: How to be in the winning side of the equation.

Hey guys. Today I wanna talk about the 51 49 concept, which is a mind-blowing concept for me. I took it from an input source from the South Valley Forum, which is the book of Pook.  Pook is a character, a highly anonymous guy from the internet that reveals a series of tactics of heuristics or techniques in order to seduce women.

 But more importantly, in order to, I remember that book stated that it was in order to. To find peace in himself, which is very alike to what I like to do. And, the women were an afterthought after he found himself in, in a way. So Pook revealed the 51:49 concept, which I applied highly in my relationships.

I remember once when I was in a nearby city and, I was with a friend and I was. I'm going to take off and at home and, but my friend invited me to some party with some female companionships and the, the 51 49 helped me in, at that moment in order to decide to not go to the party to stay on integrity and, and to have fun even in the terminal waiting. Clearly on the good side of the decision. Otherwise, I was I would be like a cannot sway, sway in the site in the sense of not aligned with my values and integrity is, is a key component of this. Series of this program, if you like, of other products that I have.

And integrity in the sense of maintaining what we want even if tempted to go in different directions, maintaining our, our stance and, and really what we, what, what we like to do in the, in the. So 51 49 came from, comes from the, the gambling ream, in the sense of this comes from the casino because the casino doesn't want to if you go to the casino, the casino doesn't want to win by a high margin because even if gamblers, for example, wants to win big, they, they end up losing almost everything, right?

The casino wins by a small margin each time, and that's the key to win winning, in my opinion. So, if you follow this rule till the end it will work wonders for you in every decision you take. And decisions are, are gut impulses, right? Sometimes and decisions from the gut don't need to have a refined story in order to be effective.

[Sometimes, we feel that we need to explain ours to other people, which is totally normal and fine, but sometimes Gut impulses tell us a better story and direct us in better ways to navigate, this world. So 51 49 is the key to those moments when you have to decide for one side or the other, and you don't want to be in the 49. right? You want to be in the 51. So that's it. The heuristic, that's the shortcut. If you want, and try to apply it, in your decisions, in important decisions or important decisions that'll feel important for you, and I think it will work wonders for you, and it would be an entry point to this, my world, and to my upcoming products.

So, Check, the link below and I will lead you to more of this decision-making and stick to foster your development. So that's it. See you around and see you the next time. Bye.
